Introduction
============
WYP_Blockchain is a blockchain implemention written in Python. The base code is heavily modified from course material provided by https://www.superdatascience.com/.

The application starts a server driven by Flask(https://flask.palletsprojects.com) hosting a blockchain implemention. Users then send blockchain commands to the application via HTTP requests. By default, the server listens on http://127.0.0.1:5000.


Usage
======
To run a unit-test on the blockchain logic and exit,
> python3 wyp_blockchain.py

To run the application,
> python3 wyp_blockchain_peer.py

To get the current chain, use the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/get-chain

To mine a new block, use the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine-block

To run a full validation of the current chain, use the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/chain-full-check
